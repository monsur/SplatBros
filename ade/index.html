	In the new set Ikoria many different types of cards were introduced including the Companion cards. This is a list of the worst to the best. I will try to keep updating this as time goes on.

Umori, the Collector is the worst Companion because of all the Companions he has the biggest set back and the smallest reward. Also the are cards such as <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/grn/174/goblin-electromancer"> Goblin Electromancer </a> that has basically the same effect, and the only difference is the fact that with Umori you can pick any card type while Goblin Electromancer is only instants and sorcerys.

  <div style="background-color: White;">
  Kaheera, the Orphangaurd is in my opinion the seconed worst Companion because it has such a big set back in your deck for such a little reward just like Umori. The set back in this card is that every creature card in your deck has to be a Cat, Elemental, Nightmare, Dinosaur or a Beast, and the reward is that every Cat, Elemental, Nightmare, Dinosaur or Beast in your deck gets +1/+1 and Vigilance. In my decks I want a lot of versatility, and having only 5 creature types of creatures cuts of 246 other types of creatures. This means you don't have much versatility when it comes to creatures, and if you decide to not run very many creatures than the set back and reward don't do much making it almost a useless companion.

Ok now we can get into the good companions. With these Companions I will say how I would use them in a deck. All of these following cards are good Companions and I would recommend trying to make a deck out of one of these.

Jegantha, the wellspring is the first card I will be going over. I put Jegantha at the 7th place spot because the set back and reward aren't bad but also aren't the best. To me this deck would be best if you made a deck made of a lot of multicolored cards, maybe even the whole deck multicolored. This kind of deck will be best because of the reward of Jegantha. The reward is a kind of ramp, but the catch is the mana can't be used to pay generic mana costs. So if you use multcolor cards not only will they be that much easier to play but you could play lots in one turn, allowing you to instantly turn the tides of a deck. Some of the best cards for this would be the
